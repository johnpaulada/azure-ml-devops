# Demo

---

We'll create a simple application for predicting the annual medical costs given some user information.

---

We'll use [Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) for creating the model.

---

We'll get the data from the [Medical Costs Personal Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).
