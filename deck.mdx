# Azure DevOps
A (probably) short introduction.

---

## What is DevOps?

---

*DevOps Definition*

---

## Azure DevOps
Formerly, Visual Studio Team Services, Azure DevOps is the newest iteration of Microsoft's software development lifecycle management system.

---

### Azure DevOps Features

---

# Demo

---

We'll create a simple application for predicting the annual medical costs given some user information.

---

We'll use [Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) for creating the model.

---

We'll get the data from the [Medical Costs Personal Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance).

---

## Let's create the model!

---

## Let's Create the User App!

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Calling the model"
  notes="This snippet makes a request to the model we created and uses the response."
  code={require("!raw-loader!./request.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { lines: [1], notes: "Makes the request to the model URL." },
    { lines: [2], notes: "Converts response to JSON format." },
    { lines: [3], notes: "Displays resulting JSON." },
  ]}
/>

---

## Let's Create the DevOps Setup!

---

### Create Azure App Service

---

### Create Build and Release Pipelines

---

Let's open up [Azure DevOps](johnpaulada.visualstudio.com) first.
